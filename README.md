## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

First, there is a section for setting the configuration of the webcam, incuding the size of images the webcam is going to capture and looking for the webcam device to use. Second, there is an additional button for user to click on the webapp to capture pictures from the webcam. The funtion will get images from the webcam and save them as jpg files in the puclic folder, later the webapp will load the saved images and show them on the website.


**b. Include a video of your working video doorbell**

## Part C. Make it your own

**a. Find, install, and try out a node-based library and try to incorporate into your lab. Document your successes and failures (totally okay!) for your writeup. This will help others in class figure out cool new tools and capabilities.**



**b. Upload a video of your working modified project**
